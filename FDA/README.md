to do list

1. the results go worse as the ridge penalty get larger. How about try a very small ridge penalty 
2. calculate the cosine similarity by using true D, or true beta or true gamma, see which one dominate the results
3. try x() + Zb instead of use the coefficiency. see whether they can get the same estimation of alpha 

solutions: 
1. use ridge penalty, seems not very well
2. pull the D1 = D2
3. let the concavity out.
