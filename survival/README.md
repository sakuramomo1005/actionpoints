we still need to construct example to let cox model mis-specify the model, otherwise, the KM can still work. 

## 2020-02-12

1. previous results, make it more clear
2. for the table, report the confidence interval, show that the true value is not in the confidence interval,
3. true exp(beta x)
4. look for joint model
5. read yuan ming's paper again, how he did the simulation 


## 2020-02-03

1. goodness fit (check whether the model fit correctly), or parametric goodness fit, model sepecified test
2. book, applied logistic regression Hosmer, (goodness fit of logistic regression)
3. model diagnosis 
4. prediction, live longer than 3 years or not 
5. try male female
6. relaxed assumption 
7. find covariates, significant for m function, not significant for cox model
8. lasso, variable selection, glmnet, fit cox model with variable selection, adaptive lasso, glmnet + binary regression

1. the proof of the relationship, has some problem, check the book, counting process, page 26, 27 the formula
2. organize the example 1, simulation. 
3. the alternative form of the rho? what is it? 
4. upload the results on the dropbox


## 2020-01-16

1. the relationship between rho and our new assumption, it is not if and only if. our assumption is looser. 
2. real data analysis and time dependent ROC
    + try real data, separate to training and testing dataset, fit the model and estimate the auc, roc, other metrics
