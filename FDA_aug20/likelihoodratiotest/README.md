For a given dataset, we would like to check whether it has a single index structrue or not, by conducting a likelihood ratio test. 

The hypothesis: 

```diff
H0: The data has a single index model structrue, i.e. drug group and placebo group share the same alpha

H1: The data does not have a single index struectrue. 
```
