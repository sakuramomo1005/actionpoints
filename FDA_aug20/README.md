## Purity calculation 

We define a longitudinal single index approach for treatment decision rule optimization. The approach is aimed to maximizes the purity, which is calculated based on Kullback Leibler divergence.

### 1. Check the optimization 

We show it by simulation, that whether the alogrithm could find the optimal alpha value. 

We simulate dataset with p = 2 dimension of predictors. We calculate the purity with alpha = (cos(theta), sin(theta)). 

The plot of theta v.s. purity is drawn.
